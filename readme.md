#FreeCodeCamp API Basejump: Image Search Abstraction Layer
### Created by Don Nguyen Ngoc (ngocdon0127)
## User stories:
- I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
- I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

##Example
``http://example.com/api/image/google?offset=10``


``http://example.com/api/latestImageSearch``
